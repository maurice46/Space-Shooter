# Space-Shooter
Space Shooter is a fast-paced, 2D arcade-style game where players control a spacecraft, navigating through a field filled with falling meteors while shooting lasers to destroy them. The objective is to survive as long as possible, score points by defeating meteors, and avoid losing all lives.

Gameplay Mechanics

- Player Control: Players control a spaceship using the arrow keys for movement. The ship can shoot lasers at meteors by pressing the spacebar, but there is a cooldown period between shots.

- Meteors: Randomly generated meteors fall from the top of the screen at varying speeds and angles. Players must avoid colliding with these meteors, as each hit deducts a life.

- Shooting and Scoring: Players earn points by destroying meteors with lasers. An animated explosion effect occurs upon destruction, enhancing the visual experience.

- Lives and Health: Players start with three lives. If a meteor collides with the spaceship, a life is lost. Upon losing all lives, the game ends.

- Timer and Score Display: The game displays elapsed time and current score on the screen, encouraging players to achieve high scores.

Visuals and Audio

- Graphics: The game features colorful, pixel-art graphics with a space theme. Background stars and animated explosions add depth and excitement to the visuals.

- Sound Effects: Laser shots and explosions are accompanied by sound effects, and background music enhances the gameplay atmosphere.
